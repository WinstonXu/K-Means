K-Means clustering algorithm on movie data.

Each centroid is a “fake” movie with ratings from users. Movie distances are compared by looking at the differences between ratings by the same user. Prints out the 10 most related movies in each cluster at the end of the program. Hard to confirm closeness because I would believe that they are related in some way. Clustering takes about 4-5 minutes.
